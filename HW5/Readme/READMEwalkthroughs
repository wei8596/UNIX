To see how this new version of the game works, let's begin by looking at
how objects can e examined:

% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 2,20p
Computer room
You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
There is a shiny brass key here.
>examine key
I see nothing special about that.
>look key
I see nothing special about that.
>x key
I see nothing special about that.
>x computer
I see nothing special about that.
>x bin
I do not see that here.
>x abc
I don't know what that is.


From the above, we see that "look" and "examine" and "x" all do the same thing.
We also see that objects can be examined, but only if they are present, either
in the room or (as we'll see in a minute) in your inventory. Also objects that
can't be taken, like the computer, can still be examined. Things that aren't
objects (like 'abc') get a different message than objects that do exist, but
are just not present at this location.


Going on, we see:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 21,50p
>e
Old Building hallway
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
>s
You can't go that way.
>e
Mailroom
You are in a mailroom.  There are many bins where the mail is usually
kept.  The exit is to the west.
>x bin
All of the bins are empty.  Looking closely you can see that there
are names written at the bottom of each bin, but most of them are
faded away so that you cannot read them.  You can only make out three
names:
                   Jeffrey Collier
                   Robert Toukmond
                   Thomas Stock

>x bins
All of the bins are empty.  Looking closely you can see that there
are names written at the bottom of each bin, but most of them are
faded away so that you cannot read them.  You can only make out three
names:
                   Jeffrey Collier
                   Robert Toukmond
                   Thomas Stock

>w
Old Building hallway

Here we see that we can move around, but not to places that don't exist as part
of the game (The door to the south of the Old Building hallway is not part of
our game). We also see that you can examine either the bin or bins -- they are
really the same thing. We also see that revisiting a room gives a one-line
description.


Now we remember that examining an item and looking at the item do the same
thing. So what happens if we don't give a object? Let's see:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 51,58p
>l
Old Building hallway
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
>x
Old Building hallway
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.

Yep, they behave identically (and so would "examine"). They display the full
description of the room.


Let's try to get the key and the computer:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 59,67p
>get key
I do not see that here.
>w
Computer room
There is a shiny brass key here.
>get key
A brass key: Taken.
>get computer
You cannot take that.

Here we see that you have to be in the right place, and that you can only pick
up certain items. In fact, the message that prints looks like the message from
programming assignment 4. (In fact, this assignment will use the sed script.)


Let's move on...
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 68,79p
>i
You currently have:
A brass key
>e
Old Building hallway
>get key
I do not see that here.
>x key
I see nothing special about that.
>i
You currently have:
A brass key

Here we see that you can examine things in you inventory (we've already
examined things in the room). We also see that we can't get things that we
already have.


Let's move on...
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 80,95p
>drop key
Done.
>drop key
You don't have that.
>i
You currently have:
>l
Old Building hallway
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
There is a shiny brass key here.
>e
Mailroom
>w
Old Building hallway
There is a shiny brass key here.

Here we see that you can drop things. When you do so, it appears in the room.


Let's try picking it up a different way:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 96,104p
>get all
A brass key: Taken.
>get all
Nothing to take.
>drop all
I don't know what that is.
>i
You currently have:
A brass key

Here we see that you can "get all" but you can't "drop all". That is how the
original game works.


Let's now try heading out the north door:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 105,111p
>n
Meadow
You are in a meadow in the back of an old building.  A small path leads
to the west, and a door leads to the south.
There is a lamp nearby.
There is a bus driver's license here.
There is a silver bar here.


There are three items here. let's pick the up, but in different ways:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 112,124p
>take lamp
A lamp: Taken.
>i
You currently have:
A brass key
A lamp
>get all
A license: Taken.
A silver bar: Taken.
>l
Meadow
You are in a meadow in the back of an old building.  A small path leads
to the west, and a door leads to the south.

Here we see that "take" works just the same as "get". We also see that "get 
all" (or "take all") will pick up everything that it can (ie, those 11 items
from programming assignment 4's sed file). Since everything was picked up,
there are no more items in the meadow.


Let's try to do a few more wrong things, just to see the types of errors
produced, and then quit:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowObjectsWork | sed -n 125,\$p
>get all
Nothing to take.
>get egg
I do not see that here.
>get abc
I don't know what that is.
>n
You can't go that way.
>hello
I don't understand that.
>quit


OK. So now we've seen that walkthrough. Let's start looking at the next one:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 2,19p
Computer room
You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
There is a shiny brass key here.
>e
Old Building hallway
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
>n
Meadow
You are in a meadow in the back of an old building.  A small path leads
to the west, and a door leads to the south.
There is a lamp nearby.
There is a bus driver's license here.
There is a silver bar here.

Here we see that we were able to go through the door, even though we did not
pick up the key. This is because we still have one more homework to do, which
will use awk. I am not assigning that yet, so our game cannot do any of the
tests for blocked movement. That means: you can go through the door wihout the
key, you can go through the gate without the bus, you can drive the bus into
buildings. All of these things happen because we don't write the code to
prevent them from happening.


Next, let's skip ahead in the walkthough. In the skipped portion, we typed
these commands: w,n,n,e,s. (You can look in the walkthrough file and see their
responses.) So now, let's see what comes after that:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 46,59p
>w
Main-Maple intersection
>n
Main-Oaktree intersection
There is a jewel-encrusted egg here.
>e
First-Oaktree intersection
There is a bus here.
>s
First-Maple intersection
There are some valuable coins here.
>n
First-Oaktree intersection
There is a bus here.


As we see, we are now in the place where the bus is. Let's try some things: 
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 60,67p
>x bus
It is a 35 passenger bus with the company name ‘mobytours’ on it.
>get bus
You cannot take that.
>board bus
You are not licensed for this type of vehicle.
>enter
You are not licensed for this type of vehicle.

Here we see that we need the license in order to board the bus. We also see
that you don't need to say "enter bus" (or "board bus"), you can just say
"enter" (or "board").


So let's go back an get the license by typing: s,w,s,e,get all,w,n,n
We'll skipp that part of the walkthrough. Here's what comes next:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 91,97p
>e
First-Oaktree intersection
There is a bus here.
>enter
You board the bus and get in the driver's seat.
>board
You are already in the bus!

Here we see that you can board the bus if you have the license. Also, there
is a special error message if you try boarding the bus while already on it.


Let's try driving the bus:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 98,100p
>w
Main-Oaktree intersection
There is a jewel-encrusted egg here.

Here we see that we have moved. If we were playing the real game, there would
be a message "The bus lurches ahead and comes to a screeching halt." We also
will, in the future, have that message -- but not until the next homework.


Let's see if we really are on the bus:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 101,106p
>x egg
It is a valuable Fabrege egg.
>get egg
You can't take anything while on the bus.
>drop lamp
You can't drop anything while on the bus.

Here we see that you can look at the egg (out of the window of the bus), but
you can't get it. You also can't drop anything (just because that's a rule in
the original game).


Let's therefore get off the bus so that we can get the egg and drop the lamp:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 107,120p
>i
You currently have:
A lamp
A license
A silver bar
>exit
You hop off the bus.
>exit
You can't go that way.
>l
Main-Oaktree intersection
You are at the north end of Main Street and the west end of Oaktree Ave.
There is a bus here.
There is a jewel-encrusted egg here.

Here we see that "exit" is how you get off the bus. And we see that you can't
get off when you already are off, so the error is "You can't go that way." (You
get the same message if you try to board the bus when it's somewhere else.)


Now that we are off the bus, we can get the egg and drop the lamp, which we
were not allowed to do when we were on the bus:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 121,126p
>get egg
A valuable egg: Taken.
>drop lamp
Done.
>board
You board the bus and get in the driver's seat.


OK, let's drive to the museum:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 127,140p
>s
Main-Maple intersection
>nw
Museum entrance
You are in front of the Museum of Natural History.  A door leads into
the building to the north, and a road leads to the southeast.
>n
Museum lobby
You are in the main lobby for the Museum of Natural History.  In the center
of the room is the huge skeleton of a dinosaur.  Doors lead out to the
south and east.
There is a dinosaur bone here.
>get bone
You can't take anything while on the bus.

Here we see that the bus has driven right into the museum. (As we've already
stated, this bug will be fixed in the next homework.)


Let's get off of the bus nd look around:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 141,149p
>exit
You hop off the bus.
>l
Museum lobby
You are in the main lobby for the Museum of Natural History.  In the center
of the room is the huge skeleton of a dinosaur.  Doors lead out to the
south and east.
There is a dinosaur bone here.
There is a bus here.


OK. So now there is a bus and a bone. What happens if we "get all"?
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBusWorks | sed -n 150,$p
>get all
A bone: Taken.
>l
Museum lobby
You are in the main lobby for the Museum of Natural History.  In the center
of the room is the huge skeleton of a dinosaur.  Doors lead out to the
south and east.
There is a bus here.
>get bus
You cannot take that.
>quit

As we would expect, "get all" ignores the bus, and "get bus" gives an error."


So now that we've learned how the bus works, there is one more complication.
Let's learn how the bone works. To do this, let's look at the third provided
walkthrough file. That walkthrough begins by typing "e,n,w,n,nw". We'll skip
over that part and see what comes next:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBoneWorks | sed -n 37,42p
>n
Museum lobby
You are in the main lobby for the Museum of Natural History.  In the center
of the room is the huge skeleton of a dinosaur.  Doors lead out to the
south and east.
There is a dinosaur bone here.

First, let us notice that we got though the gate without the bus (for the same
reason as stated before -- the next homework will fix this).


So let's go over to the maintanence room and see the button that is there:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBoneWorks | sed -n 43,56p
>e
Geological display
You are in the geological display.  All of the objects that used to
be on display are missing.  There are rooms to the east, west, and
north.
>e
Maintenance room
You are in some sort of maintenance room for the museum.  There is a
switch on the wall labeled ‘BL’.  There are doors to the west and north.
There is a packet of nitric acid here.
> switch
I see nothing special about that.
>press switch
The button is now in the on position.

Oh. This switch (or button) must have done something. Actually, what it did
was to turn on a "black light" (hence the label ‘BL’). This light is with the
tanks of fish (I guess some of them glowed in the dark). 


Let's see that:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBoneWorks | sed -n 57,67p
>w
Geological display
>n
Marine life area
You are in the marine life area.  The room is filled with fish tanks,
which are filled with dead fish that have apparently died due to
starvation.  Doors lead out to the south and east.
The room is lit by a black light, causing the fish, and some of
your objects, to give off an eerie glow.
There is a glass jar here.
There is a valuable ruby here.

Here we see that there is a message about the black light. This message does
not print if the switch is not pressed. We also note that the message says that
some of your items have an eerie glow. This message matches the original game,
but it is a lie, because the game gives this message even if you have no items
in you inventory.

Anyway, let's try re-entering the room and see what happens:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBoneWorks | sed -n 68,76p
>get all
A glass jar: Taken.
A ruby: Taken.
>s
Geological display
>n
Marine life area
The room is lit by a black light, causing the fish, and some of
your objects, to give off an eerie glow.

Here we see that the message still appears, even in the short message.


Alright now. Which object is supposed to glow? It is the bone:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBoneWorks | sed -n 77,99p
>s
Geological display
>w
Museum lobby
There is a dinosaur bone here.
>x bone
I see nothing special about that.
>get bone
A bone: Taken.
>e
Geological display
>n
Marine life area
The room is lit by a black light, causing the fish, and some of
your objects, to give off an eerie glow.
>x bone
In this light you can see some writing on the bone. It says:
For an explosive time, go to Fourth St. and Vermont.
>drop bone
Done.
>x bone
In this light you can see some writing on the bone. It says:
For an explosive time, go to Fourth St. and Vermont.


But let's turn the light off again:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBoneWorks | sed -n 100,106p
>s
Geological display
>e
Maintenance room
There is a packet of nitric acid here.
>press switch
The button is now in the off position.

Here we see that the button gives a different message when turned off.


Let's play around with press a little:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBoneWorks | sed -n 107,112p
>press
You must supply an object.
>press acid
You cannot press that.
>switch acid
You cannot press that.

We see here you must supply an object. (get and drop also require an object.)
We also see that the only object that can be pressed is the switch (it can also
be called a "button", but the file name is "switch").
We also see that the verb "switch" can be used instead of press. 


Let's now revisit the bone and verify that it looks normal without the black
light:
% cat aWalkThroughOfHowTheBoneWorks | sed -n 113,$p
>w
Geological display
>n
Marine life area
There is a dinosaur bone here.
>x bone
I see nothing special about that.
>quit


And so there you have it: a discussion of the three provided walkthroughs.
Also, there also is something you don't have: the specific description of the 
assignment details. I am making that description file, but I am posting this
FIRST so that you can read it and understand it. Do not actually start coding
the assignment until I give you more guidance.

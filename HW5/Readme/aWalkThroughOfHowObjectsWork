Computer room
You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
There is a shiny brass key here.

Mailroom
You are in a mailroom.  There are many bins where the mail is usually
kept.  The exit is to the west.
>x bin
All of the bins are empty.  Looking closely you can see that there
are names written at the bottom of each bin, but most of them are
faded away so that you cannot read them.  You can only make out three
names:
                   Jeffrey Collier
                   Robert Toukmond
                   Thomas Stock

                       Programming Assignment #2
		           Overview Document

The new homework is due on Monday March 26th at 11:59pm.

This is an overview of the assignment, so that you can read it and get an idea.
After reading this, go on to read the READMEpa2 file (once I post it, that is).


Part 1. The Actual Game

In lecture 2, we learned about the emacs text editor. Let me now tell you the
bizarre fact that emacs has some built in games. One of these is a text-based
adventure game. We will be recreating a portion of that game, as a way of
reinforcing what we have learned about UNIX in lectures 1 & 2. I will now give
some details about how to run the specific part of the game that we will be
recreating. But these details are only for your reference -- you will not
need to play the game in order to do the assignment, because I will describe
what precisely you are supposed to do, here in this document.

To begin, if you want to run the game, you open emacs. The game can be run
under the menu choice: alt-` -> tools -> games -> Adventure.
Nonetheless, the game's own help page says that it is not intended to be run
in this way. Instead it is meant to be run by typing: "emacs -batch -l dunnet"

Let's try that:

% emacs -batch -l dunnet
Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.
>


Above, we see the start of the game. The prompt has become a ">", indicating
that you are inside the game. We can type a command now. For example, we could
type "get shovel" or we could type "e", since the text says the road goes east.

But we won't type those commands, instead we'll restore a saved file, called
"house", that I have provided to you in the same posting as this README file:

% emacs -batch -l dunnet
Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.
>restore house
Done.
Computer room
You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
The panel lights are flashing in a seemingly organized pattern.
There is a shiny brass key here.
>

Above, we see that restoring the house file has advanced us to a later part of
the game (the fourth level: the level that starts in the house). The reason
that we have advanced to this point is that this fourth level is what we will
be attempting to recreate. The above text says that there is an exit to the
east. So let's continue to play the game for a bit:

> e
Old Building hallway
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
>e
Mailroom
You are in a mailroom.  There are many bins where the mail is usually
kept.  The exit is to the west.
>x bins
All of the bins are empty.  Looking closely you can see that there
are names written at the bottom of each bin, but most of them are
faded away so that you cannot read them.  You can only make out three
names:
                   Jeffrey Collier
                   Robert Toukmond
                   Thomas Stock

>

From the above, we see that we can move around the rooms and we can look at
objects that are in those rooms. The description said that the mailroom has
bins for the mail. So I typed 'x' (short for eXamine) and got a description
about the bins. In fact, we recognize this description: it is the text of the
"bins" file that I gave you in the first homework. So let's continue to play:

>e
Old Building hallway
>x bins
I don't see that here.
>

Here we see that you can't see the bins if you aren't in the room with the
bins (ie, the directory which contains the "bins" file). Let's look at some
more:

>e
Mailroom
>w
Old Building hallway
>look
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
>

From the above, we see that the original text display can be seen by typing
"look". So let's look at some more:

>w
Computer room
The panel lights are flashing in a seemingly organized pattern.
There is a shiny brass key here.
>x key
I see nothing special about that.
>x computer
I see nothing special about that.
>

From the above, we see that there are two objects in the computer room. One
object, the key, displays a message "There is a shiny brass key here". The
other object, the computer, does not display a message (which, by the way,
is like the bins, which also did not display). Another thing that we see is
that there is a message about flashing lights (we won't implement this line
about flashing lights). So let's look at some more:

>e
Old Building hallway
>look
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
>n
You don't have a key that can open this door.

From the above, we see that a key is needed to go north. (There also is a
door to the south, but that is not part of this homework.) No let's look at
some more:

>w
Computer room
The panel lights are flashing in a seemingly organized pattern.
There is a shiny brass key here.
>get key
> get computer
You cannot take that.
>e
Old Building hallway
>n
Meadow
You are in a meadow in the back of an old building.  A small path leads
to the west, and a door leads to the south.
There is a lamp nearby.
There is a bus driver's license here.
There is a silver bar here.
>

From the above, we see that some objects can be picked up, like the key.
Other objects cannot be picked up, like the computer. And there is a logic
to this: the reason that the key produced the message, "There is a shiny 
brass key here" but the computer and the bins didn't display a message is
because they cannot be picked up. We also see that the key opens the door
to the north.

Let's go just a little further:
>w
Post office
You are near the remains of a post office.  There is a mail drop on the
face of the building, but you cannot see where it leads.  A path leads
back to the east, and a road leads to the north.
>n
Main-Maple intersection
You are at the intersection of Main Street and Maple Ave.  Main street
runs north and south, and Maple Ave runs east off into the distance.
If you look north and east you can see many intersections, but all of
the buildings that used to stand here are gone.  Nothing remains except
street signs.
There is a road to the northwest leading to a gate that guards a building.
>e
First-Maple intersection
You are at the south end of First Street at Maple Ave.
>e
Second-Maple intersection
You are at the south end of Second Street at Maple Ave.
There is a jewel-encrusted egg here.
>e
Third-Maple intersection
You are at the south end of Third Street at Maple Ave.
>

From the above, we see that the directories which we made for the first 
assignment were slightly smaller than the real game: The "Second-Maple
intersection" continues east to the "Third-Maple intersection". Also, the
objects are in different places.

Part 2. Our version of the game

OK. That's enough of the actual game. For this assignment we are going to
implement a simplified version. (If you think about it, it is pretty surprising
that we can implement anything at all -- we don't know how to do make variables
or loops yet.)

Our main simplification is that we will, in this present homework, only
implement the commands: n, s, w, e, ne, sw, and look.

So let's get started:

% source play
Computer room
You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
Here there is:
 key
%

From the above, we see several differences. First, the line about flashing
lights is missing (we won't implement it this time). Second, although the
key message does display, but not in the same way as it displays in the real
game. Now let's keep going:

% pwd
/home/user/start
% ls -A
.descriptionA  computer  e  key
%

From the above, we are reminded that we are not really playing a game. We
are really just using UNIX directories and files. Let's keep going:

% get key
bash: get: command not found
% x key
bash: x: command not found
% cat key
I see nothing special about that.
% cat .descriptionA
Computer room
% 

From the above, we see that the "get" and "x" commands are not implemented
in this homework (but will be done later). Nonetheless, even though the "x"
command is not implemented, the "cat" command is able to do the same thing.
We also see that the .descriptionA file actually holds just the first line
of the description. Going further:

% e
Old Building hallway
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
% pwd
/home/user/start/e
%

From the above, we see that you can move east, and the message displays.
Now let's continue:

% n
Meadow
You are in a meadow in the back of an old building.  A small path leads
to the west, and a door leads to the south.
Here there is:
lamp  license  silver
%

From the above, we see that the key is not needed (for this homework).
Now let's continue:

% n
Meadow
Here there is:
lamp  license  silver

From the above, we see that there are no error messages for moving in a
disallowed direction (for this homework). Now let's continue:

% cat w/.descriptionE
Post office
You are near the remains of a post office.  There is a mail drop on the
face of the building, but you cannot see where it leads.  A path leads
back to the east, and a road leads to the north.
% w
Post office
You are near the remains of a post office.  There is a mail drop on the
face of the building, but you cannot see where it leads.  A path leads
back to the east, and a road leads to the north.
% cat .descriptionE
Post office
%

From the above, we see that the .description files do not start out with
only the first line (because cat w/.descriptionE showed all the lines of
the description). Let's keep going:

% e
Meadow
Here there is:
lamp  license  silver
% cat .descriptionD
Meadow
%

From the above, we are reminded that the .desciption files become just one
line long, once a room is entered. Going on:

% look
Meadow
You are in a meadow in the back of an old building.  A small path leads
to the west, and a door leads to the south.
Here there is:
lamp  license  silver
%

From the above, we see that the "look" command works, even though the
.description file lost the additional lines. Where then were they found?
Well, let's see:

% cat ~/PA2collected/descriptionD
You are in a meadow in the back of an old building.  A small path leads
to the west, and a door leads to the south.
%

From the above, we see that the original description is stored in one of
the directories that I'll give you in this homework. Moving on:

% w
Post office
% n
Main-Maple intersection
You are at the intersection of Main Street and Maple Ave.  Main street
runs north and south, and Maple Ave runs east off into the distance.
If you look north and east you can see many intersections, but all of
the buildings that used to stand here are gone.  Nothing remains except
street signs.
There is a road to the northwest leading to a gate that guards a building.
%

OK. So we nothing new to see here. Let's move on:

% e
First-Maple intersection
You are at the south end of First Street and the east end of Maple Ave.
There is a cliff off to the east.
Here there is:
 coins
% n
First-Oaktree intersection
You are at the north end of First Street and the east end of Oaktree Ave.
Here there is:
 bus
%

From the above, we see something interesting: there is a connection between
the directory with the coins and the one with the bus -- even though neither
is the parent directory of the other. This is accomplished through adding a
link, as described in the homework file.

Moving on:

% w
Main-Oaktree intersection
You are at the north end of Main Street and the west end of Oaktree Ave.
Here there is:
 egg
% s
Main-Maple intersection
% e
First-Maple intersection
Here there is:
 coins
% n
First-Oaktree intersection
 bus
% w
Main-Oaktree intersection
Here there is:
 egg
%

From the above we see that these four directories can go in a circle. Another
such link will be made between the room with the acid and the one with the
glycerine.

And that is the end of this document. I will post another file with details
on the implementation of the assignment; this present file is just an overview
to read and understand.
